# PiP Rendering Fun - Demos
> This is a set of demos to show how non-video content can be rendered in floating PiP windows, mainly by using `<canvas>` and streams.

## Demos
- [Stats](./stats/)
	- This shows how a floating PiP might be useful for keeping an eye on live stats, such as site analytics.
- [Meta](./meta/)
	- This shows how a PiP can dynamically show information about itself! How "meta" of it!
- [Time Tracker](./time-tracker/)
	- Shows how you could use PiP as a floating timer for time trackers, like Toggl.
- [Drawing](./drawing/)
	- Draw whatever you like on an empty canvas, and have it mirrored to the floating PiP.
- [Desktop](./desktop/)
	- This mirrors / renders your entire display (e.g. a whole monitor) to a floating PiP! Uses <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Capture_API/Using_Screen_Capture" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the Screen Capture API</a>.
